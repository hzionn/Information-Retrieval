# Project 2 - Documents Retrieval

We are ask to implement several different retrieval methods. 

Some of these retrieval methods will be the implementation of the basic retrieval models studied in the class (e.g. TF-IDF, BM25, Language Models with different Smoothing). 

Various tools are build on top of [Lemur Project](http://www.lemurproject.org/) toolkits, includes search engines, browser toolbars, text analysis tools, and data resources that support research and development of information retrieval and text mining.
